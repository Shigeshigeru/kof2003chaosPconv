s1grab by iq_132

This program will "grab" 512k of "S" data from the end of decrypted C roms.
You MUST use DECRYPTED C roms.  

To use the program, unzip your last two C roms (usually xxx-c7d.rom and xxx-c8d.rom) to
the same directory as s1grab.exe and then from the command line, type this:

s1grab xxx-c7d.rom xxx-c8d.rom

Please note that your file names may be different and also note that some S1 roms may require some decryption code or other processing.
